# Digital Identity Acceptance Statement

For the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, a digital identity acceptance statement will be based on the assessment of trusted processes using the trust objectives defined below. These trust objectives will have an associated set of conformance criteria that define the necessary stringency for acceptance.

A **Digital Identity Acceptance Statement** is based on the concept introduced in [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines Section 5.5](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#daps) and adapted for the purposes of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.

An [draft assessment workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYWZN9_Z1TacDSojZSSLt8r6JoWvqw5bKNTR85FhIJA/edit?usp=sharing) is being developed on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYWZN9_Z1TacDSojZSSLt8r6JoWvqw5bKNTR85FhIJA/edit?usp=sharing)

NOTE: The following is a **draft outline** of the digital identity acceptance statement. It reflects current thinking and it is evolving as more work is performed.

## Verified-Person
Verified Person ensures that a person is real, exists, and is claim their own personal information.

* Person is uniquely distinguished within a population
* Person is a real person.
* Personal information is correct according to authority.
* Personal information is attributed to the right person.

## Verified-Login
Verified Login ensures that a user has control over what has been issued to, or registered for use in an authentication, login or sign in process.

* Returning user is same as initial user.
* Returning user has exclusive control of token, key, secret, etc.
* Returning user is living person.
* Activity monitoring.
* Fraud Detection.

## Identity-Registration

Identity Registration is a composite component of three sub-components: Confirmation, Notice-Consent, and Binding.

### Confirmation

# Verified Person Acceptance Policy

Using the PCTF, a relying party, such as a government program or service provider, can develop a Verified Person Acceptance Policy. 

A Verified Person Acceptance Policy is defined as the set of conditions (rules, conformance criteria, etc.) that determine what is acceptable for use by a relying party. The set of conditions can include, but are not limited to:

* The set of verified person trusted process outputs that together can be relied on (e.g. Unique Identity Resolution,  Foundational Authoritative Record, Identity Validation, etc,);
* Evidence that conformance criteria for each trusted process have been met;
* Required level of assurance;

Additional qualifiers, such as:
* Originating jurisdictions (e.g. provinces, territories, federal, international)
* Originating sectors (e.g. financial, health, etc.)
* A relying party may define its own Verified Person Acceptance Policy, or one that is defined by the PCTF (definition is out of scope of this document)

Furthermore, a Verified Person Acceptance Policy may be part of a larger Trusted Digital Identity Acceptance Policy that may also include other components, such as:
* Verified Login
* Verified Organization
* Verified Relationship
* Consent
* Binding
* Notice

# Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1

This is the **Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1** 

The official version of this document is the PDF available at [TODO] This repository, used for development of the PCTF document suite, is available as a resource for those who prefer to view the documents in HTML form or who wish to view the original Markdown.

Because of differences in Markdown rendering engines, the best place to view the HTML is on the NIST Pages website at [TODO] rather than the GitHub rendering of the documents.

While this is believed to be a faithful representation of the official PDF documents, we would appreciate being informed about any inconsistencies that may be found other than minor formatting differences. These may be reported to <TODO>.

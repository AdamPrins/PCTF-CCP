## 1 <a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of this document is to describe the public sector profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)<sup id="fnr-PCTF">[fn-number](#fn-PCTF)</sup>.

The audience for this document includes:
* Business owners and program managers – to enable digital identity solutions in order to achieve 
business objectives or program outcomes;
* Regulatory and oversight bodies – to understand the implications on their role in the digital ecosystem; and
* Digital identity technology and service providers – to understand where they fit in the digital ecosystem 
and to help define requirements for their products and services.

Definitions of various terms used in this document can be found in Appendix A: Terms and Definitions.

## 2 <a name="PCTF"></a>THE PAN-CANADIAN TRUST FRAMEWORK


### 2.1 Overview

#### 2.1.1 Background

The identity management ecosystem in Canada is comprised of multiple identity providers relying on authoritative 
source registries that span provincial/territorial and federal jurisdictions. Consequently, the Canadian ecosystem 
employs a federated identity model. 

The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) is an outcome of the Pan-Canadian approach
for federating identities which is an agreement on the principles and standards to be used when developing identity 
solutions<sup id="fnr-identityAssurance">[fn-number](#fn-identityAssurance)</sup>. This approach, embodied in the PCTF, is intended to facilitate 
the transition to a digital ecosystem which will enable transformative digital service delivery solutions for citizens 
and residents of Canada.

#### 2.1.2 What is the PCTF?

he PCTF is a model that consists of a set of agreed-on concepts, definitions, processes, conformance criteria, and an 
assessment approach. It is not a “standard” as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing 
standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional 
criteria. The role of the PCTF is to complement existing standards and policies such as those concerned with security, 
privacy, and service delivery.

The PCTF facilitates a common approach between the public sector and the private sector. Use of the PCTF ensures alignment, 
interoperability, and confidence of digital identity solutions that are intended to work across organizational, sectoral, 
and jurisdictional boundaries. In addition, the PCTF supplements existing legislation, regulations, and policies.

The PCTF supports the acceptance and mutual recognition of:
* Digital identities of entities such as persons and organizations; and
* Digital relationships between entities.

The PCTF is technology-agnostic and is defined in a way that encourages innovation and participation in the digital ecosystem. 
It allows for the interoperability of different platforms, services, architectures, and technologies. Furthermore, the PCTF is 
designed to take into consideration international digital identity frameworks, such as:
* The Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services (eIDAS);
* The Financial Action Task Force (FATF); and
* The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

Finally, it should be noted that the Public Sector Profile of the PCTF, in itself, is not a *governance* framework. 
Instead, it is a tool to help assess a digital identity program or service.

#### 2.1.3 Scope of the PCTF

Currently, the scope of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework is:
* Persons in Canada: all citizens and residents of Canada (including deceased persons) for whom an identity 
has been established in Canada;
* Organizations in Canada: all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which 
an identity has been established in Canada; and
* Relationships in Canada: of persons to persons, organizations to organizations, and persons to organizations.




### 2.2 The PCTF Model

The PCTF Model, as shown in Figure 1, is a high-level overview of the PCTF in diagram
form.

![Figure 1: The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Model](/images/PCTF-V1_1_FINAL.png)

The PCTF model consists of four main components:
1. A **Normative Core** component that encapsulates the key concepts of the PCTF;
2. A **Mutual Recognition** component that outlines the current methodology that is used to assess and 
certify actors in the digital ecosystem;
3. A **Supporting Infrastructure** component that describes the set of operational and technical policies, 
rules, and standards that serve as the primary enablers of a digital ecosystem; and
4. A **Digital Ecosystem Roles and Information Flows** component that defines the roles and information 
flows within the digital ecosystem.

All items in the "Normative Core" component are prescriptive. The section on the "Mutual Recognition" component 
describes a recommended methodology but it is not mandatory that the methodology be followed. The sections on the 
“Supporting Infrastructure” and "Digital Ecosystem Roles and Information Flows" components are descriptive only and 
not prescriptive.

The four components of the PCTF are described in more detail in the subsequent four sections of this document 
(Sections 2.3 to 2.6 inclusive).

<a name="fn-PCTF">[fn-number](fnr-PCTF)</a> Development of the public sector profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework is a 
  collaborative effort led by the Joint Councils of Canada, a forum consisting of the Public Sector Chief Information 
  Officer Council (PSCIOC) and the Public Sector Service Delivery Council (PSSDC). This document has been developed by 
  the Public Sector Profile PCTF Working Group (PSP PCTF WG) for the purposes of discussion and consultation, and its 
  contents have not yet been endorsed by the Joint Councils. This material is published under the Open Government License –

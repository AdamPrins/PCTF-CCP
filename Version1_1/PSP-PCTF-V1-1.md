# Executive Summary
The PCTF supports the acceptance of digital identities and digital relationships by defining a set of discrete process patterns, known as atomic processes. These atomic processes can be mapped to existing business processes, independently assessed using conformance criteria1, and certified to be trusted and interoperable within the digital ecosystem.
